# Reverse Polish Notation Interpretter 🐫
I made this repo mostly to learn some more OCaml. Specifcially, I wanted more experience working with recursion in OCaml and list-based operations. This interpretter uses a stack based approach to RPN, building up the stack until operators are input. I'm sure better solutions exist, but this has been a pretty cool langauge exploration for me :)
